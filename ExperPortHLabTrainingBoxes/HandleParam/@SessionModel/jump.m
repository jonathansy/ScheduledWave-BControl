% [obj] = jump(obj, varargin)
%
% jump(obj, idx) allows moving back and forward in training stages
% idx: The index of the training stage to jump back/forward to
%
% example: in a set with 5 entries, suppose the 3th stage is actively being
% evaluated
%  >> jump(obj,1) ---> marks stages 1, 2, 3 as being incomplete and sets 1 as
% being the currently active stage
%  >> jump(obj,5) --> marks stages 3, 4 as being complete and sets 5 as the
% currently active stage
%
% All stages *before* the active stage are marked as completed; the
% stage you jump to, the currently active stage, is marked as not
% complete.If you want to mark ALL stages as complete, jump to one more
% than the number of stages your session model has. E.g.:
%
%  >> jump(obj, 6) --> marks all stages, 1 through 5, as
%         complete. Since we only have 5 stages total, stage 5 is also
%         the current one.
%
% If jumping to the current training stage, any local SessionModel
% SoloParamHandles (vars) associated with that stage will be deleted,
% recreated, and reinitialized
