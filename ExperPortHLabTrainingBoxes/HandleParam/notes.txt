Add helper files as in InitializeUIEdit, etc.

Set up an 'is_numeric' field for the edit param. If this is on, and
something non-numeric comes in, a warning is issued, but the value is
not accepted...

Set up automatic string or number value system for menus

Eliminate the practice of allowing SoloFunction to capture handles by name.

Add a fullname field (subdirs+subfuncs), to allow load and save to
work correctly. This will allow private namespaces within helper functions!
Hmm... really need only m-file name and subfunc name, that's it...
