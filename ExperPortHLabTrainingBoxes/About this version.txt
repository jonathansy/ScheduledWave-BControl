Heavily modified by CDB starting April 05. Major addition is the virtual RP Box. Also, 3 sounds
can be defined per trial, not two. New save/load settings and save/load data methods that assign
automatic time-stamped filenames. Top-to-bottom overhaul -- better yet, a rewrite starting
from zero -- likely coming soon.
