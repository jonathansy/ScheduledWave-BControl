% Usage:
% Beep=MakeSwoop( SRate, Attenuation, Frequency, Duration, [RiseFall] )
% Create a sinusoidal beep at frequency Frequency in Hz of duration
% SRate is the sample rate in Hz.
% Attenuation is a scalar (0 dB is an amplitude 1 sinusoid.)
% If a Attenuation is a vector, a harmonic stack is created with these attenuations.
% Frequency in Hz
% Duration in milliseconds
% A fifth optional parameter RiseFall specifies the 10%-90%
% rise and fall times in milliseconds using a cos^2 edge.
