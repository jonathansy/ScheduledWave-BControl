This describes the basic steps to start Matlab and get a protocol running.

(1) Run beginit.m (right-click on it, then choose "run")

(2) In the RPBox window, at the top you will find a menu
   "protocols"-- choose the one you want. (E.g., for water valve
   calibration, choose Solo_WaterValve2)

(3) Click on "Run" in the RPBox window-- this tells the RTFSM to get
   going.


-----


For Solo_WaterValve2 using them with the valves:

 * All times in secs

 Set inter-pulse interval to 0
 Set pulses/train to 1
 Set Inter-train interval to tme between dispenses 
   (typically 1 sec)
 Set #trains to # of dispenses you want
 
Set Left_dispense time and right_time, and go.
