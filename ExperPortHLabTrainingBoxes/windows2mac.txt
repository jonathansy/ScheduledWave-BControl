This file contains a list of things to do to port Exper from Windows
to the Mac on Matlab 7 (Release 14).

(1) In ROOT/mystartup.m, make sure all the directories say "filesep"
rather than "/" or "\"


(2) In ROOT/mystartup.m, make sure the line setting the data path
preference says
	setpref('carlos', 'control_datapath', [pwd filesep 'data'])

   Do the same in ROOT/Modules/Control.m


(3) As a workaround for the problem with popup menus that Matlab 7 has
(their bug, not ours), insert at the end of
ROOT/Utility/ModuleFigure.m

   hP = uipanel;
   set(hP, 'Units', 'normalized', 'Position', [0 0 1 1]);
   set(hP, 'Tag', 'ContainerPanel');
   set(h,'ResizeFcn', ['myhP = findobj(gcf, ''Tag'', ''ContainerPanel''); ' ...
    'set(myhP, ''Units'', ''pixels''); set(myhP, ''Units'', ''normalized'')']);

   This produces a parent panel under which all other controls in the
   figure will be placed. It also adds a workaround for panel resizing
   when the figure is resized.

(4) In ROOT/Utility/SetParam.m, at line 153, change the line that says

    set(h(n),'background',get(get(h(n),'parent'), 'color'));

   into one that says

    set(h(n),'background', get(get(get(h(n),'parent'),'parent'), 'color'));

   This is because there is now an extra parent (the ContainerPanel,
   see (3) above) in between a control and the Figure that it is in.


(5) In ROOT/Utility/InitParamUI.m, insert the line

    hP = findobj(fig, 'Tag', 'ContainerPanel');

    after the first few lines of the function (i.e., after 'fig' has
    been defined and has acquired a value).
	
   In lines 48 through to the end (i.e., after "switch style", make
   sure that all uicontrols have hP as their parent.


(6) Do

   >> warning('off','MATLAB:dispatcher:InexactMatch')

   This so that case-mismatched filenames don't cause alarum.

(7) In ROOT/Utility/uigetfolder.m, insert the following lines at the
    top of the function (i.e., completely rewrite the function to
    this):

    if nargin < 2, initial_path = []; end;
    if nargin < 1, title = []; end;
    folder = uigetdir(initial_path, title);
    return;


(8) In Line 714 of ROOT/Modules/Control.m, replace the part that says
	
   	w = dir([GetParam(me,'modpath') '\*.m']);
   with	
   	w = dir([GetParam(me,'modpath') filesep '*.m']);

   (i.e., make sure we have a filesep, not a Windows-specific \).


(9) In line 5 of ROOT/FakeRP/@lunghao1/Run.m,

   replace the lowercase "run(lh1.rp_machine)" with an uppercase
   "Run(lh1.rp_machine)"

(10) In line 10 of ROOT/FakeRP/MakeSigmoidSwoop2.m, replace
   '\PPFilter.mat' with
   filesep 'PPFilter.mat'
