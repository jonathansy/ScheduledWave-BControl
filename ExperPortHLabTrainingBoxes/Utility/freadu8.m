function a = freadu8(name,offset,numbytes)
%FREADU8 Read bytes from a file into a uint8 array.
%   A = FREADU8(FNAME, OFFSET, NUMBYTES) reads NUMBYTES from the
%   file FNAME starting at OFFSET.  A is returned as a uint8
%   column array.  Note that the length of A is the number of
%   bytes successfully read, which may be less than NUMBYTES.
%
%   OFFSET defaults to 0.  If NUMBYTES is not specified, FREADU8
%   reads from OFFSET to the end of the file.
